> [!NOTE]
> The _x suffix in the config file indicates the codename of the system version you are using. Reversed alphabet, lowercase incremental. Those without suffixes are mostly the factory Android version (not always, please check the info inside). Currently, I only added devices with Android15 (i.e., _v suffix) in the preselection. If you're using other Android versions, manually change _v to the correct code, provided it actually exists

>So, if your build time exceeds the maximum time for your model, please stop and rerun, and check the steps, especially the Initialize Repo and Sync step. This often fails due to upstream REPO toolchain issues. If this step takes more than 15min, try again. If it still fails, wait for a fix
 
------
> [!CAUTION]
> Do not use volume down to install modules during root-retaining updates, use volume up to skip! Generally, installation is no longer necessary, just use the SukiSU Ultra Add-on Module  
>
> If your kernel is `6.6`, and you previously used the official script to build,but now want to use `Fast Build`, please **restore** the following images first:`dtbo.img`, `system_dlkm(.erofs).img`,**otherwise the device may fail to boot!**  
>
> If you have enabled the `ZRAM` algorithm, make sure to install the `ZRAM` module **before rebooting** after flashing with `Anykernel3`. You may need to adjust some parameters manually.The 5.10 kernel is not supported `ZRAM` , as the `zram.ko` module path could not be found.However, the generated ``Anykernel3`` is still usable  
>
>``OnePlus Ace5`` does not support enabling FengChi. Older models cannot use it even if the kernel includes it — do not force it

# Features in Development
- [ ] ccache supports AB update mode
- Toothpaste should be squeezed bit by bit, GPUs should be cut slice by slice, PPTs should be shown slide by slide, and code should be written line by line — more features and optimizations... stay tuned!
 
# Changelog
> Minor updates will be ignored. For more details, please refer to the commit.
 
-- Allow modifying `SUBLEVEL`,Used to fix the issue where the device fails to boot after a system update changes the `SUBLEVEL` but the kernel source has not been updated.Disabled by default. Default value is `99`. Modify if needed.
```
6.1.75->6.1.99
```  
 
-- Upgrade `LZ4` to `1.10.0`.  <- **`beta`**  
 
-- Allows running multiple workflows in batches of 9 each time.`CAll Build Start UP` is an **extremely dangerous** new workflow.**It has no new features and everything remains default and non-customizable**.This workflow is **strictly prohibited** for regular users and should use `Build OnePlus_SukiSU Ultra All` instead!If you must use this workflow, make sure you have the ability to clear the cache generated by ccache,and you must **immediately clean up** the cache for all devices after every batch of 9 is completed,otherwise it will negatively impact performance.  
 
-- Support setting branches and custom version identifiers.  
```
Set Branch: Change the original `susfs-main` to another `susfs-*` branch. Please modify according to the channel name in the SukiSU Ultra repository. Do not modify unless you are a developer. Do not leave it empty or remove it.
Custom Version Tag:
Replace the original commit hash with your custom content, and move the commit hash to the end. This can be modified freely, but keep it reasonably short.
v3.1.7-f5541e21@susfs-*
↓
v3.1.7-CustomContent@susfs-*[f5541e21]
If you don’t want to use a custom version tag, just leave it empty (e.g. susfs-main/).
Whether or not you use a custom version tag, the branch and the custom tag must be separated by a slash ("/", U+002F). Do not remove it.
```  
 
-- Remove file-map and build method selection; let the main workflow decide automatically [@Bouteillepleine](https://github.com/Bouteillepleine).  
 
-- First to support custom kernel build time `UTS_VERSION` for all device models and all build methods.  
 
--Use `ccache` to speed up the workflow, only effective when `fast build` is enabled.The cache needs to be regenerated by changing the `key` when using it for the first time or after major updates, which may reduce the speed.
```
You can delete all keys by enabling the "是否删除所有ccache缓存" option in the delete.yml(name: 清理工作流运行记录和缓存) workflow.
You can also go to
https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name/actions/caches
to manually delete the corresponding keys.  
When there is a kernel-level update or a significant slowdown caused by changes in the GitHub upstream toolchain, you need to perform the above actions.
```  
 
-- First to support for the sm8750's new setlocalversion format using echo, fixing the issue where custom and randomly-generated pseudo-official suffixes were not applied. Now, this feature is fully supported across all device models and build methods.  
 
-- Add `TRUSTY_EXISTS` to automatically detect whether the `6.6` kernel has defects in the kernel source code and determine whether `sed` is needed.  
 
-- Support enabling fongchi driver for selected devices (optional), driver from [@HanKuCha](https://github.com/HanKuCha).  
 
-- When `ZRAM` is enabled, automatically download and modify the ZRAM additional module. [@FURLC](https://github.com/FURLC)  
 
-- Fix issues where `ZRAM` is unusable or unable to launch non-system apps.  
 
-- Fix the problem that the official script cannot run when the kernel version is between `5.15.0-5.15.123`, and the result of the quick compilation has problems. [@zzh20188](https://github.com/zzh20188)  
 
-- Allow custom kernel suffix.  <- **`beta`**
```
1. When the custom kernel suffix is empty, a random string is used instead of the default “x.xx.xxx-androidxx-8-o-g3b1e97b8b29f”
2. When custom suffix is enabled, the kernel version is modified to “x.xx.xxx-androidxx-CustomContent”, and the original “androidxx-8-o-g3b1e97b8b29f” is no longer retained.
3. When using clang make (Fast Build), add the missing kernel android version number to the new source kernel information x.xx.xxx-o-g3b1e97b8b29f, and then perform operations in 1 or 2.
```  
 
-- Support fast-build `(5.10[Debut], 5.15[Debut], 6.1, 6.6)`.  
 
-- Fixed OnePlus Ace5Pro and OnePlus 13 boot issues after build failure; using official dtbo now allows booting directly. [@reigadegr](https://github.com/reigadegr)  
 
-- Support displaying user-defined inputs during `Debug Show Selected Inputs` step; workflow name will also reflect some values.  
 
-- Removed potential version codes from the suffix of `Anykernel3.zip` config file, replaced with exact `Android` version numbers `XX.X.X`.

AnyKernel3_SukiSUUltra_12896_oneplus_11_Android14.1.0_KPM_VFS.zip
```  
 
-- Added support for the `LZ4K` compression algorithm in the `zram` module.   [@ShirkNeko](https://github.com/ShirkNeko)  
 
-- Support automatic download of latest `CI` version of `susfs` module and install via `ksud`; also automatically extracts manager `CI-APK` but does not install it.  
 
-- Supports `KPM` (copy without modifications;optional) and `VFS HOOK` (optional).
